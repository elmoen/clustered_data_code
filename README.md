# clustered_data_code
Code to accompany “Analyzing clustered data: Why and how to account for multiple observations nested within a study participant?”

The commands for the "other software" (R, Matlab, and SAS) are for a continuous outcome for which linear models can reasonably be assumed. We provide the primary function and cluster-relevant sub-commands. We recommend that readers use help facilities to guide them towards making exact specifications for the problem they are working on.
