Analysis in R
  lm function
  fixed-effect model, specify clusters using factor command (e.g., factor(mouseid))
  
  library(gee)
    gee function
    marginal model, specify clusters with the id sub-command in the model statment (e.g., id=mouseid)
    The gee package is a user-contributed package: see more athttps://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gee/index.html
  
  library(lme4)
    lmer function, for basic clustering the notation of (1|mouseid) in the model statement is used to specify that observations are clustered within the 'mouseid' variable.
    mixed-effect model
    The lme4 package is a user-contributed package: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lme4/index.html
  
  
Analysis in Matlab

  fitlm function
  For fixed-effects, the user would need to implement the variable with the cluster indicators as a series of dummy variables for each level.

  GEEQBOX toolbox
    marginal model, the cluster variable is specified with the id input in the model statement.
    GEEQBOX is not part of the statistical module of Matlab but is a user-contributed package: see more at http://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v025i14
  
  fitlme function
    mixed-effect model, for basic clustering the notation of (1|mouseid) in the model statement is used to specify that observations are clustered within the 'mouseid' variable.


Analysis in SAS
  PROC GLM
    fixed-effect model, use class statement to identify the cluster variable as categorical and list variable as per normal in the model statement

  PROC GENMOD
    marginal model, use class statement to identify the cluster variable as categorical and the repeated command to specify that multiple observations are made on that variable

  PRsOC MIXED
    mixed-effect model, use class statement to identify the cluster variable as categorical and the RANDOM sub-command to indicate that its effects are treated as random
    
Note: these packages and functions were not specifically implemented in our manuscript. Rather, this serves as a starting point for a reseracher who prefers using a statistical software other than Stata. Each of these functions contain addition options and outputs that the software will provide.
