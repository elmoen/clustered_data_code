Analysis in R
  library(gee)
    gee function
    marginal model
  
  library(plm)
    lm function
    fixed-effect model, specify clusters using factor command (e.g., use factor(mouseid) for example dataset)
  
  library(lme4)
    lmer function
    mixed-effect model
  
  
Analysis in Matlab
  GEEQBOX toolbox
    marginal model. see more at http://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v025i14
  
  fitlme function
    mixed-effect model

  fitlm function
  For fixed-effects, the user would need to implement the variable with the cluster indicators as a series of dummy variables for each level.
  
Analysis in SAS
  PROC GENMOD
    marginal model

  PROC GLM
    fixed-effect model, use class statement to identify a variable as categorical and list variable as per normal in the model statement
  
  PRsOC MIXED
    mixed-effect model, use class statement to identify the cluster variable as a categorical variable and the RANDOM sub-command to indicate that its effects are treated as random
    
Note: these packages and functions were not specifically implemented in our manuscript. Rather, this serves as a starting point for a reseracher who prefers using a statistical software other than Stata. Each of these functions contain addition options and outputs that the software will provide.
