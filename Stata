Stata code for statistical models described in the main text

Key
Variable names:
somasize = continuous variable of soma size for each neuron
fattyacid = factor of 0, 1, or 2 indicating no treatment, vehicle control, or fatty acid treatment respectively
pten = factor of 0 or 1 indicating control or Pten shRNA, respectively
mouseid = factor specifying mouse identity for each neuron
meanss = mean soma size
prp = proportion of cells with Pten knockdown per mouse
numobs = number of neuron measurements per mouse



Code corresponding to Table 3
Experimental subset: control neurons from mice that received fatty acid or vehicle control delivery (pten = 0 and fattyacid = 1 or 2)

1)	Cell-level linear regression
	reg somasize fattyacid 


2)	Mouse-level regression (mean); no weighting
	reg meanss fattyacid 


3)	Mouse-level regression (mean); weighting – analytic weights
	reg meanss fattyacid [w=numobs]

4)	Marginal regression
	#First set mouseid as the panel variable (cluster identities), then perform the regression
	xtset mouseid
	xtgee somasize fattyacid, corr(exch) robust

5)	Mixed-effect regression 
	#Use of “variance robust” obtains variance estimates that are robust to violations of the distribution assumption due to misspecification of the model
	xtset mouseid
	xtmixed somasize fattyacid || mouseid:, variance robust cov(exch)


Stata code corresponding to Table 4
Experimental subset: mice that remained naïve to either fatty acid or vehicle control delivery (fattyacid = 0)

1)	Cell-level linear regression
	reg somasize pten 


2)	Marginal regression
	xtset mouseid
	xtgee somasize pten, corr(exch) robust

3)	Fixed-effect regression 
	xtset mouseid
	xtreg somasize pten, fe

4)	Mixed-effect regression 
	xtset mouseid
	xtmixed somasize pten || mouseid:, variance robust cov(exch)

Stata code corresponding to Table 5
Experimental subset: mice that remained naïve to either fatty acid or vehicle control delivery (fattyacid = 0)

1)	Mouse-level weighted regression 
	reg meanss prp [w=numobs]

2)	Marginal regression
	xtset mouseid
	xtgee somasize prp pten, corr(exch) robust

3)	Mixed-effect regression
	xtset mouseid
	xtmixed somasize prp ||mouseid:, variance robust cov(exch)

4)	Mixed-effect regression with pten as a fixed effect
	xtset mouseid
	xtmixed somasize prp pten || mouseid:, variance robust cov(exch)

Stata code corresponding to Table 6
Experimental subset: mice that were in the fatty acid and vehicle control groups (fattyacid = 1 or 2).

1)	Interaction effect between Pten knockdown and fatty acid delivery
	#Set mouseid as panel variable, generate vectors of interaction effects, and then perform the regression 
	xtset mouseid
	gen fa1_pten=(fattyacid==1)*pten
	gen fa2_pten=(fattyacid==2)*pten
	xtmixed somasize pten fattyacid fa1_pten fa2_pten || mouseid:, variance robust cov(exch)

Intra-class correlation (ICC)
#After performing the mixed-effect model with the ‘xtmixed’ command, you can calculate the ICC of your data with the following command:

	estat icc
